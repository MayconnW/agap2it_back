# agap2it_back

This backend was made with NodeJs. It is used as an example of what it can be. 

## Installation

There aren't special steps here and you just need to have the NodeJs installed in your pc. To install NodeJs follow this link (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating). It's not mandatory you have "yarn" installed, but I recommend it. You can follow this link (https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/).

After you make sure you have NodeJs on your computer: 
1 - git clone "https://github.com/MayconnW/agap2it_back.git";
2 - Open the terminal inside the directory and run the command "yarn". This will install all the dependencies.
3 - Inside the directory yet, now run the command "yarn dev". This will play the server in the 3333 port.

That's all you need :)

Soon I'll create a docker image with this server. 

Soon I'll deploy it in Heroku.
